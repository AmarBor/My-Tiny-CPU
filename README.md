# My-Tiny-CPU

 MY tiny CPU, which included an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit. To build and simulate the CPU, 
 I utilized Altera Quartus II, a popular software suite for digital logic design and verification. Through this project, 
 I gained extensive knowledge in CPU design and development, as well as experience in using digital logic design tools. 
 This project was not only challenging but also immensely rewarding, as it allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to develop a sophisticated solution to a complex problem.
